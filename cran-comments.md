The one note pertains to the size of the package: installed size is  5.1Mb

This is a resubmission. 
Fixed the notes from the previous cran submission:    
- Changed title to title case       
- Started description field with different word: "This package" instead of "habtools".      
- Fixed doi notation in documentation of function rdh_theory       
- Disabled running longer examples.

Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:   
  habtools (16:5)    
  rugosity (16:230)   
  sphericity (16:270)    
--> These words are not misspelled.
