<!-- badges: end -->

A collection of functions for sampling and simulating 3D surfaces and objects and estimating metrics like rugosity, fractal dimension, convexity, sphericity, circularity, second moments of area and volume, and more.

### Installation

The best way to install `habtools` is through cran.                
``` r
install.packages("habtools")
```

You can also install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jmadinlab/habtools")
```

### Examples

There are vignettes demonstrating the use of `habtools` for digital elevation models (DEMs) and 3D meshes, as well as a vignette covering fractal dimension methods. 

There are currently two data sets accompanying this package. `horseshoe` is a DEM of a coral reef in RasterLayer format, and `mcap` is a 3D mesh of a coral growing on a reef in mesh3d format.

The following example calculates height range, rugosity and fractal dimension of a 2 x 2 m plot of `horseshoe`.

```{r example1, message=FALSE}
library(habtools)
library(raster)

# Let's take a subset DEM of size = 2
dem <- dem_crop(horseshoe, x0 = -465, y0 = 1265, L = 2, plot = TRUE)

# height range
hr(dem)

# rugosity
rg(dem, L0 = 0.0625)

# fractal dimension
fd(dem, method = "hvar", keep_data = TRUE, plot=TRUE, diagnose = TRUE)

```

The next example calculates height range, rugosity and fractal dimension for the coral colony `mcap`. Because 3D meshes can have more than one `z` coordinate for a given `xy` (i.e., they have overhangs), we use cube counting for fractal dimension.

```{r setup2, message = FALSE}
library(rgl)
options(rgl.printRglwidget = TRUE)
plot3d(mcap)
```

```{r example2}
# height range
hr(mcap)

# rugosity
rg(mcap, L0 = 0.045)

# fractal dimension
fd(mcap, method = "cubes", keep_data = TRUE, plot=TRUE, diagnose = TRUE)

```
