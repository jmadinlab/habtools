# habtools

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of habtools is to collate tools for 3D meshes and digital elevation models (DEM) targetted at biologists and ecologists. Tools calculate metrics like surface area, rugosity, fractal dimension, heigh range, convexity, sphericity, second moments of volume and more. The initial set of tools came from two research papers.Zawada et al. (2019) examined morphology of coral colony laser scans. Torres-Pulliza et al. (2020) examined  complexity of coral reef structure. It is hoped that the corpus of tools and number of project contributors will grow through time.

## Installation

You can install the released version of habtools from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("habtools")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jmadinlab/habtools")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(habtools)

# Calculate height range, rugosity & fractal dimension at horseshoe reef
# within 2 x 2 m plot (extent) and at 0.25 m resolution (grain)

raster::plot(horseshoe, asp=1)

hr(horseshoe, x=-470, y=1266, L=2, plot=TRUE)
rg(horseshoe, x=-470, y=1266, L=2, L0=0.25, plot=TRUE)

L <- 2
data <- hvar(horseshoe, x=-470, y=1266, L=L, Lvec=L/c(1, 2, 4, 8))
fd(data, method="mean")

# Compare fractal dimension of `M. capitata` colony using
# height variation and cube counting methods

cubes(mcap, L0=0.01, plot=TRUE)

dem <- mesh_to_dem(mcap, res=0.015)
L <- dim(dem)[1] * raster::res(dem)[1]
data <- hvar(dem, raster::xmin(dem), raster::ymin(dem), L, Lvec=L/c(1, 2, 4, 8))
fd(data, plot=TRUE, method="ends")

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
# summary(horseshoe)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
# plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
