Description: This package is a collection of tools for 3D 
  meshes and digital elevation models (DEM) targetted at biologists
  and ecologists. Tools calculate metrics like surface area, rugosity, 
  fractal dimension, heigh range, convexity, sphericity, second moments
  of volume and more. The initial set of tools came from two research papers.
  Zawada et al. (2019) examined morphology of coral colony laser scans. 
  Torres-Pulliza et al. (2020) examined  complexity of coral reef structure. 
  It is hoped that the corpus of tools and number of project contributors 
  will grow through time.
