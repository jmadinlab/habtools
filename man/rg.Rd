\usage{
rg(
  data,
  L0,
  method = "area",
  parallel = FALSE,
  ncores = (parallel::detectCores() - 1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Digital elevation model of class RasterLayer or a triangular mesh of class mesh3d.}

\item{L0}{Grain or resolution of calculation.}

\item{method}{If data is a RasterLayer methods "hvar" or "area" are allowed. Defaults to "hvar".}

\item{parallel}{Logical. Use parallel processing? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{ncores}{Number of cores to use if parallel = TRUE.
(Defaults to umber of available cores - 1)}

\value{
Rugosity value

\description{
Rugosity is defined as the surface area divided by the planar area. For digital elevation models, there are two methods: "hvar" and "area".
The "hvar" method for calculating rugosity is described in Torres-Pulliza et al. (2004) and is based on height variations.
The "area" method uses the \code{\link[sp:surfaceArea]{sp::surfaceArea()}} function and is detailed in Jenness (2004).
\code{method} is ignored if \code{data} is a mesh3D object.
In that case the function uses \code{\link[Rvcg:vcgArea]{Rvcg::vcgArea()}} to calculate surface area of a triangular mesh of class mesh3d.
