\title{Calculate second moment of area}
\usage{
sma(mesh, axis = "z", scale = TRUE, origin = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mesh}{A triangular mesh of class mesh3d.}

\item{axis}{The axis along which to calculate the second moment of area. z is the default.}

\item{scale}{Logical. Scale the object to have an area = 1? Default = TRUE.}

\item{origin}{Logical. Set the origin to the bottom left corner of bounding box? Default = TRUE.}
}
\value{
SMA value.
}
\description{
Calculates the 2nd moment of surface area about the origin by multiplying the surface area of
each triangle in the mesh by its distance from the origin (should be set to
the attachment point of the mesh). The sum of these values is the 2nd moment
of area.

\examples{
sma(mcap)
sma(mcap, scale = TRUE)
